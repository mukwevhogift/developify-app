/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Developify (Prototyping Phase 1)
 *
 * @corePhilosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 *                   allowing users to only read and write their own data. This design simplifies
 *                   the rules and improves security.
 *
 * @dataStructure: User profiles are stored in the `/users/{userId}` collection, where `{userId}`
 *                  corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID of the user.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions:
 *   - Users can only access their own documents. Listing all users is disallowed.
 *   - An admin role is reserved for the future and managed separately, but is not active in this prototype.
 *   - Data shape is not strictly enforced to allow for rapid prototyping. Only fields critical for authorization
 *     (like 'uid' and 'id') are validated.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization:
 *   - The `User` document stores the `uid` field, which is a duplicate of the `userId` path parameter. This
 *     denormalization allows the rules to quickly verify user ownership without additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation:
 *   - No public/private data segregation is implemented in this prototype. All user data is considered private
 *     and stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
